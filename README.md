# CapstoneUWM

Hey Folks,

As a UW-Milwaukee student, I spearheaded a transformative capstone project aimed at streamlining university workflows. Project aims to revolutionize the university experience by creating a user-friendly, automated, and responsive web development platform. Prospective and current university students will have seamless access to essential facilities such as transportation to Milwaukee and housing options near campus, all from a single portal.

Key Features:
1) Comprehensive Transportation Solutions
2) Housing Locator
3) Interactive Discussion Corner
4) Automated Notifications
5) Responsive Design

This innovative web development project aims to redefine the university experience by providing students with a user-friendly, automated, and responsive platform. By integrating essential services and fostering community engagement, it aims to empower students and enhance their overall university journey.
